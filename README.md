# Smart Trash Project (IoT)

One of the technologies currently developing is the Internet of things (IoT). IoT has the potential to transmit data from the network without the need to prioritize directly from human to human and human to computer. Data from sensors that are placed in the trash will detect the amount of waste and will send information to the user. The sensor will send data through the gateway to the Mongo distributed database and then the data will be processed on the spark. After the data is processed on Spark, the data will be returned to the Mongo database. After the data has entered Mongo, access the data with restfullhttp to read json and display it in applications with mobile users. This design creates a monitoring system that will provide information on the height of the waste to the user or garbage collector. Accumulation of garbage is one of the problems that arise in waste handling. The garbage collection system that is regularly scheduled in one day does not know directly the condition of the trash so that the state of the trash is not controlled.
